#Extending and integrating django-report-builder

Format 
------

Note many python format features require >= 2.7
http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string-formatting

You may add formats in /admin/report_builder/format. See http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-examples

There are also some examples included in the south migrations. If you use south django-report-builder comes with
a few formats for you.

Integrations
------------

Coming Soon - but basically extend the django templates.
